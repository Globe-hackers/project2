DESCRIPTION

In the context of our bootcamp at Ironhack we were asked to build an app where users could login and logout and add, create, update and delete content.

Because we were both big travelers and big fans of South America, we decided to create a website to share our stories so that it could inspire other people for their travels. We also would love to read form other travelers and get their tips so that we could then try them out later.

On our application you will be able to bookmark your favourite stories, but only if you are loggedin. The same applies if you want to create, add, or delete content.

We hope that you will have fun reading these stories and that they will help you get inspired for your next travels.

The world is our playground, let's never stop playing !
